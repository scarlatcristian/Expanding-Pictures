# Expanding-Pictures

The project presents how to create a visual effect where the user can expand a picture by clicking on in while keeping the other hidden

The pictures are taken from https://www.pexels.com/ and made by the creators:

- Shane Aldendorff for the spring picture
- Travis Rupert for the summer picture
- Artem Saranin for the autumn picture
- Burak The Weekender for the winter picture
